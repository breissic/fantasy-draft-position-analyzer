Zero RB: A Contrarian Approach to Asset Allocation

Zero RB is a contrarian strategy that fundamentally inverts the traditional draft hierarchy. It involves completely fading the running back position in the early rounds—typically for the first five to six rounds, and sometimes longer—in favor of building a dominant corps of elite players at other positions.20

Core Principle and Execution

The strategy is an explicit arbitrage play on the volatility of the running back position. It operates on the premise that early-round running backs carry a high risk of busting due to injury or underperformance, making them inefficient investments of high draft capital.20 Instead, a Zero RB manager uses those valuable early picks to build a massive, stable weekly advantage at the less volatile wide receiver and tight end positions, and often secures an elite quarterback as well.22
The draft is only the first phase of this strategy. The second phase involves constructing a viable running back group from the middle and late rounds by targeting specific player archetypes with a clear path to future value 20:
Pass-Catching Backs: Players with a defined receiving role who offer a safe weekly floor, especially in PPR formats.
High-Upside Handcuffs: Clear backups to established starters who would inherit a massive workload in the event of an injury.
Players in Ambiguous Backfields: Running backs in committees where no clear starter is defined, offering a discounted chance to emerge with the lead role.
Athletic Prospects and Rookies: Physically gifted players who could earn a larger role as the season progresses.

Risk/Reward Analysis

When a Zero RB plan succeeds, the result is a true "juggernaut" team.21 The roster is anchored by elite, consistent production at WR and TE, and if just one or two of the late-round running back "lottery tickets" hit, the team becomes overwhelmingly strong at every position.
The risk, however, is substantial. If none of the late-round running backs emerge, the team is left with a weekly production black hole at the position that even an elite receiving corps cannot overcome.22 Furthermore, the strategy's success is predicated on the health and performance of its own early-round non-RB picks; a major injury to an elite WR or TE can be just as devastating.22 This approach is not simply a draft-day tactic but a season-long commitment that requires hyper-vigilant and aggressive management of the waiver wire to acquire the running backs who inevitably gain value as the season unfolds.21

Core Principles & Directives

Directive: Do not draft any running backs within the first five to six rounds of the draft.20
Directive: Use all early-round draft capital to acquire an elite corps of Wide Receivers and Tight Ends, and optionally an elite Quarterback.22
Principle: This strategy is an arbitrage play on the high injury rate and volatility of the running back position.20
Directive: In the middle and late rounds, target a high volume of RBs with specific upside profiles: pass-catchers, high-upside handcuffs, and players in ambiguous backfields.20
Principle: This is a season-long strategy that requires aggressive and vigilant waiver wire management to acquire running backs who gain value.21
