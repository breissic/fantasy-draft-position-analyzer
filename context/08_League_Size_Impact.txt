League Size: The Amplification of Scarcity

The number of teams in a league directly correlates with the scarcity of talent. As league size increases, the player pool is stretched thinner, and strategic priorities must adjust accordingly.
In smaller leagues (8-10 teams), the talent pool is deep. Every team can typically roster high-quality players at every starting position, and the waiver wire remains populated with viable options. Positional scarcity is a minimal concern, which allows for maximum strategic flexibility.32
Conversely, in large leagues (14+ teams), scarcity is amplified across all positions.32 The quality of a "replacement-level" player drops precipitously. This makes drafts far more fragile, as positional runs become longer and more devastating.32 Waiting too long on any position can be punitive, leaving a team with a significant roster hole that is difficult to fill. This amplified scarcity often acts as a "forcing function." While a manager in a 10-team league might
choose to employ a Zero RB strategy, a manager in a 16-team league may be forced to draft a quarterback or running back earlier than desired simply to avoid being left with a non-viable starter. In these larger formats, draft strategy often shifts from pure value optimization to a more defensive posture focused on avoiding catastrophic roster weaknesses.

Core Principles & Directives

Principle: In small leagues (8-10 teams), positional scarcity is minimized, allowing for maximum strategic flexibility and value-based drafting.32
Principle: In large leagues (14+ teams), positional scarcity is amplified across all positions, making the player pool significantly thinner.32
Directive: In large leagues, be prepared to address positions of need earlier than you would in smaller formats to avoid being left with a non-viable starter.
Principle: Positional runs are longer and more punitive in large leagues, creating a more fragile draft environment.32
Directive: In large leagues, shift focus from pure value optimization to a more defensive posture that prioritizes avoiding catastrophic roster weaknesses.
