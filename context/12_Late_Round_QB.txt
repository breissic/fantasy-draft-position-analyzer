Late-Round QB: Exploiting Value at the Quarterback Position

Foundational Rationale: Opportunity Cost and Positional Value

The Late-Round QB strategy is an analytical approach to roster construction rooted in the economic principle of opportunity cost.7 Its central thesis is that in standard, single-quarterback formats, the cost of acquiring a quarterback in the early rounds (typically rounds 2-4) is prohibitively high when measured against the value lost at other, scarcer positions. While some managers allocate premium draft capital to secure an elite quarterback, the Late-Round QB practitioner uses those same picks to build a formidable corps of running backs and wide receivers, where top-tier talent is more limited and positional advantages are more pronounced.6
This strategy is viable primarily because in 1-QB leagues, the supply of fantasy-relevant quarterbacks frequently exceeds the weekly demand. This creates a deep pool of talent and a relatively flat performance curve among the mid-to-late tier quarterbacks, meaning the drop-off in production is less severe than at other positions.3 The fundamental bet of the Late-Round QB strategy is that the point differential gained by drafting an elite RB or WR in the third round over a mid-round alternative is significantly greater than the point differential conceded by starting a tenth-round QB instead of a third-round QB. It is an active exploitation of this value discrepancy, aiming to capture approximately 80% of an elite quarterback's production for a fraction of the draft capital cost. This is a direct, structural application of Value-Based Drafting (VBD), where the focus is on maximizing marginal value across the entire roster rather than optimizing a single position.3

Identifying Late-Round Archetypes

Successful execution of the Late-Round QB strategy requires not just patience, but a clear understanding of the specific player archetypes that offer value in the later rounds. These can be broadly categorized into two distinct profiles.
The first, and often most potent, archetype is the "Konami Code" Upside Play. This term refers to quarterbacks who possess significant rushing ability, which provides both a stable weekly scoring floor and an explosive, league-winning ceiling.7 Rushing yards are worth more than passing yards on a per-unit basis in most scoring systems, and rushing touchdowns are a massive source of fantasy points. This group often consists of young, athletic quarterbacks who may still be developing as passers but whose fantasy value is disproportionately buoyed by their contributions on the ground.8 Players like Caleb Williams, Drake Maye, or Kyler Murray, who have demonstrated the ability to accumulate significant rushing yardage, fit this profile and can provide elite fantasy production even if their passing statistics are not top-tier.9
The second archetype is the Stable Veteran, or System QB. This profile represents a higher-floor, lower-ceiling alternative. These are typically established pocket-passing quarterbacks who operate within high-volume, efficient offensive systems and are surrounded by strong offensive lines and skilled pass-catchers.11 While they may lack the week-winning rushing upside of the "Konami" archetype, they offer reliable, consistent QB1-level production and are often available in the double-digit rounds of a draft.8 Players like Dak Prescott or Jared Goff, known for their passing volume and efficiency within potent offenses, exemplify this archetype.8
A truly sophisticated application of the Late-Round QB strategy often involves creating a portfolio by pairing these two archetypes. A manager can invest a mid-to-late round pick (e.g., round 9-10) on a high-upside "Konami" quarterback and then use a final-round pick to secure a stable veteran as an insurance policy.12 This creates a hedged position at the quarterback spot. The high-upside player provides a clear path to a league-winning ceiling, while the veteran provides a safe floor for the early weeks of the season, covers the bye week, or serves as a reliable replacement in case of injury or underperformance. This transforms the strategy from a single, high-risk bet into a calculated, multi-asset investment designed to maximize the probability of securing a viable season-long starter without expending premium draft capital.

Risk/Reward Analysis and Execution

The primary reward of a successful Late-Round QB strategy is a roster with a significant structural advantage at the running back and wide receiver positions, built by allocating all early- and mid-round draft capital to those spots.7 If one of the late-round quarterback selections proves to be a breakout star—as was the case with Jayden Daniels in 2024—the resulting roster can become a true "juggernaut," dominant at nearly every position.7
The principal risk is that the late-round targets fail to emerge, leaving the manager to "stream" the position for the entire season by picking up different quarterbacks from the waiver wire based on weekly matchups. This can result in a consistent, week-to-week point deficit at the quarterback position that can be difficult to overcome, even with a strong supporting cast of running backs and receivers.7 The strategy's viability is also threatened if a "run" on quarterbacks occurs earlier than anticipated, which can deplete the pool of quality late-round targets and force the manager to either reach for a lesser player or be left with undesirable options.3
The effectiveness of this strategy is often inversely correlated with the overall competency of the league. In drafts where managers are highly attuned to modern fantasy principles and correctly value quarterback rushing upside, the "Konami Code" archetypes will be drafted earlier, shrinking the window of value for the Late-Round QB practitioner.7 The principles of positional scarcity demonstrate that as a desirable player pool thins, its value dynamically increases, forcing managers to adapt their strategy in real-time.3 Therefore, executing this approach requires not only a pre-draft plan but also the ability to accurately read the draft room and understand the league's specific market dynamics for the quarterback position.

Core Principles & Directives

Principle: In 1-QB formats, the opportunity cost of using an early-round pick on a quarterback often outweighs the marginal point gain over a later-round alternative. 7

Directive: De-prioritize the quarterback position in the early rounds (1-7), instead allocating that draft capital to build an elite corps of RBs and WRs. 6

Principle: The modern NFL has created two primary archetypes of valuable late-round quarterbacks: the high-upside rusher and the stable veteran in a potent offensive system. 7

Directive: In the late rounds (8+), target one or two quarterbacks who fit these archetypes, ideally pairing a high-ceiling player with a high-floor player. 12

Principle: The viability of this strategy is dependent on league-specific draft trends; an early run on quarterbacks can diminish the pool of quality late-round targets. 3

Directive: Be prepared to pivot and draft a QB earlier than planned if the value at other positions dries up and a clear tier-drop at QB is imminent. 6
