Robust RB: Prioritizing a Foundational Rushing Attack

The Robust RB strategy is a classic approach that involves investing heavily in the running back position with early-round draft capital.13

Core Principle and Execution

The execution of a Robust RB build typically involves selecting at least two running backs with the first three picks, and often three or even four RBs within the first five to six rounds.13 The objective is to secure an overwhelming advantage at the running back position, filling both starting slots and often the flex spot with premium talent before addressing other positions.15
This strategy is rooted directly in the principle of positional scarcity. Proponents argue that the supply of elite, high-volume running backs is extremely limited, and the value cliff after this top tier is the steepest in fantasy football.17 By cornering the market on this scarce asset, a manager not only builds a dominant positional group but also exacerbates scarcity for the rest of the league, forcing opponents into weaker, less reliable options.17

Risk/Reward Analysis

The potential reward of a successful Robust RB build is immense. If the selected running backs remain healthy and perform to expectations, the resulting team can be nearly unstoppable, dominating opponents weekly with superior production from the most valuable fantasy position.13
However, this is arguably the riskiest of all common strategies. It concentrates a massive percentage of premium draft capital into the single most volatile and injury-prone position in football.13 A significant injury to just one of these early-round picks can be damaging, and an injury to two can be catastrophic, as the team will be inherently weak at wide receiver and tight end. The strategy is a high-variance play designed to capture a "legendary" seasonâ€”a statistical outlier where a running back so dramatically outscores the field that he becomes a prerequisite for a championship.13 It is also a form of market manipulation, intended to induce a panic-driven run on running backs that creates value opportunities at other positions later in the draft.

Core Principles & Directives

Directive: Invest heavily in the Running Back position, selecting at least two with your first three picks and three within the first five rounds.13
Principle: This strategy is a direct play on positional scarcity, attempting to corner the market on the most valuable and limited asset.17
Directive: Aim to fill all starting RB slots and the flex position with premium running back talent before significantly addressing other positions.15
Principle: This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy that concentrates draft capital into the most volatile and injury-prone position.13
Principle: A successful Robust RB build creates a nearly insurmountable weekly advantage, but a key injury can cripple the entire roster structure.
